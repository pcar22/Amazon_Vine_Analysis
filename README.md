# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to received reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.


## Results
    - There is a total of 60 reviews from paid Vine members.
    - There are 34 5-star reviews from paid Vine members.
    - The percentage of 5-star reviews from paid Vine members is .5666.

    - There is a total of 14,477 reviews from unpaid Vine members.
    - There are 8,212 5-star reviews from unpaid Vine members.
    - The percentage of 5-star reviews from unpaid Vine members is .5672.

## Summary
The results show that despite the lower number of reviewers from the Amazon Vine program, 60 compared to 14,477, the percentage of 5 star reviews were basically the same as the unpaid Vine reviewers. This could indicate a non bias towards giving a 5 star ratings due to the fact that you were given free product.

We could run another analysis to confirm a purchase of the product versus a non purchase.
